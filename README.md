# Game-1024
The 1024 game, a classic puzzle game, challenges players to strategically merge numbered tiles on a grid to reach the elusive 1024 tile.
Use the arrow keys (or WASD keys) to slide tiles in the desired direction.
Tiles with the same number merge when they collide, forming a new tile with double the value.
Continue merging tiles strategically to reach the elusive 1024 tile and achieve the highest score possible.
